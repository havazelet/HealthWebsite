But if you are like many Americans, you are busy, you have a sedentary job, and you haven't yet changed your exercise habits. The good news is that it's never too late to start. You can start slowly, and find ways to fit more physical activity into your life. To get the most benefit, you should try to get the&nbsp;recommended amount of exercise &nbsp;for your age. If you can do it, the payoff is that you will feel better, help prevent or control many diseases, and likely even live longer.</p><image src=\"https://i2.wp.com/therunnerdad.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/runner_sunrise1-1.jpg?fit=775%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"530\" height=\"230\" /><h3>What are the health benefits of exercise?</h3><p>Regular exercise and physical activity may</p><ul><ul><li><strong>Help you control your weight.</strong>&nbsp;Along with diet, exercise plays an important role in&nbsp;controlling your weight &nbsp;and preventing&nbsp; obesity. To maintain your weight, the calories you eat and drink must equal the energy you burn. To lose weight, you must use more calories than you eat and drink.</li></ul></ul><br /><ul><ul><li><strong>Reduce your risk of heart diseases.</strong>&nbsp;Exercise strengthens your heart and improves your circulation. The increased blood flow raises the oxygen levels in your body. This helps lower your risk of&nbsp; heart diseases &nbsp;such as&nbsp; high cholesterol,&nbsp;coronary artery disease, and&nbsp; heart attack. Regular exercise can also lower your blood pressure and triglyceride levels.</li></ul></ul><br /><ul><ul><li><strong>Help your body manage blood sugar and insulin levels.&nbsp;</strong>Exercise can lower your&nbsp;blood sugar&nbsp;level and help your insulin work better. This can cut down your risk for&nbsp;metabolic syndrome&nbsp;and&nbsp;type 2 diabetes. And if you already have one of those diseases, exercise can help you to manage it.</li></ul></ul><br /><ul><ul><li><strong>Help you quit smoking.&nbsp;</strong>Exercise may make it easier to&nbsp;quit smoking&nbsp;by reducing your cravings and withdrawal symptoms. It can also help limit the weight you might gain when you stop smoking.</li></ul></ul><br /><ul><ul><li><strong>Improve your mental health and mood.&nbsp;</strong>During exercise, your body releases chemicals that can improve your mood and make you feel more relaxed. This can help you deal with&nbsp;stress&nbsp;and reduce your risk of&nbsp;depression.</li></ul></ul><br /><ul><ul><li><strong>Help keep your thinking, learning, and judgment skills sharp as you age.&nbsp;</strong>Exercise stimulates your body to release proteins and other chemicals that improve the structure and function of your brain.</li></ul></ul><br /><ul><ul><li><strong>Strengthen your bones and muscles.&nbsp;</strong>Regular exercise can help kids and teens build strong bones. Later in life, it can also slow the loss of bone density that comes with age. Doing muscle-strengthening activities can help you increase or maintain your muscle mass and strength.</li></ul></ul><br /><ul><ul><li><strong>Reduce your risk of some cancers,&nbsp;</strong>including&nbsp;colon,&nbsp;breast&nbsp;,&nbsp;uterine, and&nbsp;lung&nbsp;cancer.</li></ul></ul><br /><ul><ul><li><strong>Reduce your risk of falls.&nbsp;</strong>For older adults, research shows that doing balance and muscle-strengthening activities in addition to moderate-intensity aerobic activity can help reduce your risk of falling.</li></ul></ul><br /><ul><ul><li><strong>Improve your sleep.&nbsp;</strong>Exercise can help you to fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.</li></ul></ul><br /><ul><ul<li><strong>Improve your sexual health.&nbsp;</strong>Regular exercise may lower the risk of&nbsp;erectile dysfunction&nbsp;(ED) in men. For those who already have ED, exercise may help improve their sexual function. In women, exercise may increase sexual arousal.</li></ul></ul><br /><ul><li><strong>Increase your chances of living longer.&nbsp;</strong>Studies show that physical activity can reduce your risk of dying early from the leading causes of death, like heart disease and some cancers.</li></ul><h3>How can I make exercise a part of my regular routine?</h3><ul><ul><li><strong>Make everyday activities more active.</strong>&nbsp;Even small changes can help. You can take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk down the hall to a coworker's office instead of sending an email. Wash the car yourself. Park further away from your destination.</li></ul></ul><br /><ul><ul><li><strong>Be active with friends and family.</strong>&nbsp;Having a workout partner may make you more likely to enjoy exercise. You can also plan social activities that involve exercise. You might also consider joining an exercise group or class, such as a dance class, hiking club, or volleyball team.</li></ul></ul><br /><ul><ul><li><strong>Keep track of your progress.</strong>&nbsp;Keeping a log of your activity or using a fitness tracker may help you set goals and stay motivated.</li></ul></ul><br /><ul><ul><li><strong>Make exercise more fun.</strong>&nbsp;Try listening to music or watching TV while you exercise. Also, mix things up a little bit - if you stick with just one type of exercise, you might get bored. Try doing a combination of activities.</li></ul></ul><br /><ul><li><strong>Find activities that you can do even when the weather is bad.</strong>&nbsp;You can walk in a mall, climb stairs, or work out in a gym even if the weather stops you from exercising outside.</li></ul></div></section></div>",

        "description": "Fitness is for life. Motivate yourself with these practical tips.",
        "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Have you ever started a fitness program and then quit? If you answered yes, you're not alone. Many people start fitness programs, but they may stop when they get bored, they don't enjoy it or results come too slowly. Here are seven tips to help you stay motivated.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Start with simple goals and then progress to longer range goals. Remember to make your goals realistic and achievable. It's easy to get frustrated and give up if your goals are too ambitious.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example, if you haven't exercised in a while, a short-term goal might be to walk 10 minutes a day five days a week. An intermediate goal might be to walk 30 minutes five days a week. A long-term goal might be to complete a 5K walk.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For most healthy adults, the Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. Aim to incorporate strength training exercises of all the major muscle groups into your fitness routine at least twice a week.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1584907600887-9732fa3647ac?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1080&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjE3MDMxOX0\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"264\" /></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Find sports or activities that you enjoy, then vary the routine to keep it interesting. If you're not enjoying your workouts, try something different. Join a volleyball or softball league. Take a ballroom dancing class. Check out a health club or martial arts center. Discover your hidden athletic talent.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Remember, exercise doesn't have to be boring, and you're more likely to stick with a fitness program if you're having fun.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If it's hard to find time for exercise, don't fall back on excuses. Schedule workouts as you would any other important activity.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can also slip in physical activity throughout the day. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk up and down sidelines while watching the kids play sports. Take a walk during a break at work. Pedal a stationary bike or do strength training exercises while you watch TV at night.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Research has found that sitting for long periods of time may negatively affect your health, even if you otherwise get the recommended amount of weekly activity. If you sit for several hours a day at work, aim to take regular breaks during the day to move, such as walking to the water fountain to get a drink of water or standing during phone conversations.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Are you hoping to lose weight? Boost your energy? Sleep better? Manage a chronic condition? Write down your goals. Seeing the benefits of regular exercise and writing your goals down on paper may help you stay motivated.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You may also find that it helps to keep an exercise diary. Record what you did during each exercise session, how long you exercised and how you felt afterward. Recording your efforts and tracking your progress can help you work toward your goals and remind you that you're making progress.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You're not in this alone. Invite friends or co-workers to join you when you exercise. Work out with your partner or other loved ones. Play soccer with your kids. Organize a group of neighbors to take fitness classes at a local health club.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After each exercise session, take a few minutes to savor the good feelings that exercise gives you. This type of internal reward can help you make a long-term commitment to regular exercise.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">External rewards can help too. When you reach a longer range goal, treat yourself to a new pair of walking shoes or new tunes to enjoy while you exercise.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you're too busy to work out or simply don't feel up to it, take a day or two off. Be gentle with yourself if you need a break. The important thing is to get back on track as soon as you can.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now that you've regained your enthusiasm, get moving! Set your goals, make it fun and pat yourself on the back from time to time. Remember, physical activity is for life. Review these tips whenever you feel your motivation slipping.</p>",

Here is how these healthy habits were defined and measured:</p><p><strong>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Healthy diet</strong>, which was calculated and rated based on the reported intake of healthy foods like vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, healthy fats, and omega-3 fatty acids, and unhealthy foods like red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fat, and sodium.</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp; Healthy physical activity level</strong>, which was measured as at least 30 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous activity daily.</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp; &nbsp;Healthy body weight<em>,</em></strong> defined as a normal body mass index (BMI), which is between 18.5 and 24.9.</p><p><strong>4.&nbsp; &nbsp;Smoking</strong>, well, there is no healthy amount of smoking. “Healthy” here meant never having smoked.</p><p><strong>5.&nbsp; &nbsp;Moderate alcohol intake</strong>, which was measured as between 5 and 15 grams per day for women, and 5 to 30 grams per day for men. Generally, one drink contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol.
